# Machine Learning Models Comparison

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates and compares several popular machine learning algorithms for classification tasks. The algorithms included are:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Neural Networks

## Overview

The notebook covers the following aspects for each algorithm:
- Introduction to the algorithm
- Implementation using popular libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- Training and evaluation on a sample dataset
- Performance comparison and analysis

## Usage

1. Open the MAGIC ML(https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18AM7zBsOrNpZBv0yp6ODny4DwiqEapyu#scrollTo=FR1znzhzzbR8) in your browser.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the cells and observe the results.

## Requirements

The notebook is designed to run on Google Colab, which comes pre-installed with the necessary libraries. If you want to run it locally, ensure you have the following packages installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` or `keras`

## Algorithms Included

### 1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Description: A powerful classifier that works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the classes.
- Library: scikit-learn
- Example Usage: `from sklearn.svm import SVC`

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Description: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies a sample based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors.
- Library: scikit-learn
- Example Usage: `from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier`

### 3. Naive Bayes
- Description: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions.
- Library: scikit-learn
- Example Usage: `from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB`

### 4. Neural Networks
- Description: A flexible, multi-layered learning model inspired by the human brain, capable of learning complex patterns.
- Library: TensorFlow or Keras
- Example Usage: `from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential`

## Results and Analysis

The notebook includes a section where the performance of each algorithm is evaluated and compared based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizations are provided to help understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
